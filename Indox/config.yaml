  document_relevancy_prompt: 'You are a grader assessing relevance of a retrieved
    document to a user question. If the document contains keywords related to the
    user question, grade it as relevant. It does not need to be a stringent test.
    The goal is to filter out erroneous retrievals.

    Give a binary score ''yes'' or ''no'' score to indicate whether the document is
    relevant to the question.

    Provide the binary score as a JSON with a single key ''score'' and no preamble
    or explanation.

    Here is the retrieved document:
