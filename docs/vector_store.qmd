# Vector Store Integration in Indox


## Overview

Indox supports three vector stores for document retrieval: Postgres
using pgvector, Chroma, and Faiss. This section provides an overview of
the base vector store class and detailed instructions for configuring
and using each supported vector store.



## Postgres Using PgVector

To use pgvector as the vector store, users need to install pgvector and
set the database address.

### Installation

For instructions on installing pgvector, refer to the pgvector
installation guide.

``` python
from indox.vector_stores import PGVectorStore
db = PGVectorStore(embedding=embed,collection_name="sample")
```

## Usage

Connect to the vector store:

``` python
Indox.connect_to_vectorstore(db)
```

Store documents in the vector store:

``` python
Indox.store_in_vectorstore(chunks=docs)
```
