# The Multimodal LLM

The **Multimodal LLM Chat API** is a specialized programming interface designed to enable interactions with advanced natural language processing models like **Claude**, **Gemini**, and **GPT-4**. These models generate human-like responses to various inputs and queries, while also accepting documents, images, and text inputs.

## Workflow Overview

A process flow for an AI-driven application using OpenAI's GPT-4 model (or other LLMs) combined with **Phoenix**'s multimodal capabilities.

Here's an explanation of the workflow and its potential use cases:

### 1. Input Node (File Upload)
- Accepts a file as input, which serves as the source data for GPT-4's processing.

### 2. Processing Node (GPT-4 Chat)
- Processes the uploaded file using a defined prompt to perform tasks such as:
  - Summarization
  - Extraction
  - Analysis
- The output is passed to the next stage.

### 3. Database Storage Node
The processed data is stored in one of the following databases based on the application needs:

#### **SQLite**
- Suitable for lightweight or local storage needs.
- Example:
  - Create a table to store processed data (e.g., file names and content).
  - Insert the processed data into SQLite using SQL queries.

#### **MongoDB**
- Ideal for scalable, NoSQL storage of unstructured or semi-structured data.
- Example:
  - Store processed data in a MongoDB collection.
  - Each file is represented as a document with fields like `file_name` and `processed_content`.

#### **ChromaDB**
- Best for storing vector embeddings, especially for search or similarity tasks.
- Example:
  - Store vectorized data along with metadata like file names.
  - Enable advanced queries on the data.

### 4. Output Node
- Results stored in the database can be retrieved or displayed as needed.
- Example:
  - Query SQLite for specific records.
  - Retrieve documents from MongoDB.
  - Search embeddings in ChromaDB for downstream tasks.

## Example Use Cases

### 1. **Text Summarization**
- **Input**: Upload a long text file (e.g., research papers or reports).
- **Output**: GPT-4 generates a concise summary.

### 2. **Content Extraction**
- **Input**: Upload legal documents or contracts.
- **Output**: GPT-4 extracts key details like dates, names, and obligations.

### 3. **Multimodal Analysis**
- **Input**: Upload image files.
- **Output**: GPT-4 analyzes and describes the image contents (if multimodal capabilities are enabled).

### 4. **Translation**
- **Input**: Upload a file in one language.
- **Output**: GPT-4 translates it into another language.

### 5. **Data Preprocessing**
- **Input**: Upload a CSV file.
- **Output**: GPT-4 processes it by cleaning data, filling missing values, or generating insights.

### 6. **Code Analysis**
- **Input**: Upload a code file.
- **Output**: GPT-4 provides explanations, suggestions, or debugging advice.

## Tailoring the Workflow

To adapt this flow to your specific needs:

1. **Identify Input Types**: Determine the file types relevant to your application.
2. **Define Clear Prompts**: Use well-crafted prompts to guide GPT-4 for effective processing.
3. **Configure Output Formats**: Customize the output to fit your requirements (e.g., textual, tabular, or graphical).
