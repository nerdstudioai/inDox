She planted the branch on her mother's grave, and the tree grew into a handsome tree. Cinderella would sit beneath the tree, weep, and pray, and a little white bird would always come to her. This bird helped Cinderella by providing her with the beautiful dresses and shoes she needed to attend the wedding at the king's palace. Ultimately, with the help of the magical tree and the little white bird, Cinderella was able to overcome the obstacles set by her stepmother and stepsisters and attend the royal wedding, leading to her happy ending.\""
