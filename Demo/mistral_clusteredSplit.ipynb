Later, at the wedding of a king\\'s son, the maiden\\'s two stepsisters try to gain favor with her. However, the same birds that helped the maiden earlier peck out one eye from each stepsister as they walk to the church and the other eye as they return, punishing them for their wickedness and falsehood.\", \\'The documentation appears to be a retelling of the classic fairy tale \"Cinderella.\" A prince attends a ball and dances only with a mysterious maiden, who eventually escapes him and returns home. The prince follows her but loses her near a pear tree. Suspecting she may be Cinderella, the father chops down the tree, but she is not found. The prince finds a golden slipper left behind by Cinderella and uses it to identify her. When Cinderella tries on the slipper, it fits perfectly, confirming her identity to the prince. The stepmother and stepsisters are shocked and enraged by this revelation.\\', \"In the provided documentation, a king\\'s son is searching for the owner of a golden slipper. Two sisters attempt to fit the shoe by cutting off their toe and heel respectively, but their deceit is revealed by two pigeons who alert the prince to the blood in the shoe. Finally, the true owner of the shoe, Cinderella, is found and the pigeons confirm her identity by singing that the shoe fits her perfectly and there is no blood in it. The prince takes Cinderella as his bride, and the pigeons perch on her shoulders.\", \"The documentation contains four variations of the Cinderella fairy tale. In all versions, Cinderella is mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters. With the help of magical beings or birds, she attends a festival or ball and captures the heart of a prince. In three versions, a glass or golden slipper is left behind and used to identify Cinderella. The stepsisters\\' deceit is exposed, and Cinderella and the prince live happily ever after. In one version, Cinderella\\'s stepsisters are punished by having their eyes pecked out by birds.\"]'"
