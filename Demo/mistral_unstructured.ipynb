However, it can be inferred that she might reach her happy ending through the help of a magical bird and the invitation to a three-day festival given by the king. Cinderella expressed a wish to the bird, and it threw down to her what she had wished for. The king also gave orders for a festival which was to last three days, and to which all the beautiful young girls in the country were invited, in order that his son might choose himself a bride. Cinderella wished to attend the festival, but her stepmother did not allow her to go.
