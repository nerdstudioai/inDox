    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to securely handle `inDox` as system for question answering system with open source models which are available on internet like `Mistral`. so firstly you should buil environment variables and API keys in Python using the `dotenv` library. Environment variables are a crucial part of configuring your applications, especially when dealing with sensitive information like API keys.\n",
