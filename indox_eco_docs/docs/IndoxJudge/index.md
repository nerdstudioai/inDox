## Key Features

### 1. Advanced Metrics
Evaluate models on various dimensions, including:

- **Relevance**: How well does the model's output align with the input query?

- **Faithfulness**: Does the output stay true to the input data or reasoning process?

- **Bias and Fairness**: Assess for harmful biases, stereotypes, or discriminatory patterns.

- **Toxicity and Safety**: Identify toxic or harmful outputs to ensure safety and compliance.
